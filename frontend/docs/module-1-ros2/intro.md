# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

## Overview
Welcome to the first module of the **Robo Ai Text Book**. In this section, we lay the foundation for all robotic intelligence: the middleware.

Just as a biological brain needs a nervous system to transmit signals to muscles and receive signals from nerves, an Artificial Intelligence needs a middleware to control motors and read sensors.

## Curriculum
1. **[Middleware for Robot Control](./01-middleware.md)**: Why we use ROS 2.
2. **[Nodes, Topics, & Services](./02-nodes-topics-services.md)**: The architecture of specific robotic processes.
3. **[Bridging Python Agents](./03-python-agents-rclpy.md)**: Connecting modern AI to classical control stacks.
4. **[Understanding URDF](./04-urdf-humanoids.md)**: Defining the physical body of the robot.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will understand how to:
- Spin up a ROS 2 node.
- Write a Python script that talks to a robot.
- Read and understand a robot's physical description file.
