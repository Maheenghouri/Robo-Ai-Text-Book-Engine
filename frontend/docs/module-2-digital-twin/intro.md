# Module 2: The Digital Twin

## Overview
Welcome to **The Digital Twin**. In the previous module, we learned how to control a robot. Now, we will learn how to build the world it lives in—without spending a dime on hardware.

Simulation is the playground of Physical AI. It allows us to train robots millions of times faster than real time, safely and cheaply.

## Curriculum
1. **[Physics Simulation](./01-physics-simulation.md)**: Building the virtual world layers.
2. **[Gazebo Basics](./02-gazebo-basics.md)**: Handling gravity, collisions, and SDF.
3. **[Unity for HRI](./03-unity-hri.md)**: Photorealism and Human-Robot Interaction.
4. **[Simulating Sensors](./04-sensors-lidar-imu.md)**: Giving the robot eyes (LiDAR/Cameras) and inner ear (IMU).

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Create a simple simulation world in Gazebo.
- Understand the difference between visual and collision meshes.
- Explain how to bridge Unity photorealism with ROS logic.
- Visualize simulated sensor data in RViz.
