# Physics Simulation and Environment Building

## The Importance of the Digital Twin
Before a robot takes its first step in the real world, it walks a million miles in the digital one. A **Digital Twin** is a virtual replica of the robot and its environment, governed by the laws of physics.

## Building the Virtual World
Environment building involves three layers:

1.  **Visual Mesh**: What the camera sees (textures, lights).
2.  **Collision Mesh**: What the robot bumps into (simplified geometry for speed).
3.  **Inertial Properties**: Mass, Center of Mass (CoM), and Friction limits.

## Tools of the Trade
-   **Blender**: For creating 3D assets.
-   **Gazebo**: For physics-first robotic simulation.
-   **Unity/Unreal**: For photorealistic human-robot interaction environments.

> "A robot that succeeds in simulation has a fighting chance in reality. One that fails in simulation is guaranteed to fail in reality."
