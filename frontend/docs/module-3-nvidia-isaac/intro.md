# Module 3: The Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview
Welcome to **The Brain**. In previous modules, we built the Nervous System (ROS 2) and the World (Digital Twin). Now, we give the robot intelligence.

This module focuses on the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, which provides the high-performance computing required for modern AI perception and navigation.

## Curriculum
1. **[Advanced Perception](./01-advanced-perception.md)**: From pixels to meaning (CNNs, Transformers).
2. **[NVIDIA Isaac Sim](./02-isaac-sim.md)**: The Omniverse-powered simulator for synthetic data.
3. **[Isaac ROS & VSLAM](./03-isaac-ros-vslam.md)**: GPU-accelerated localization and mapping.
4. **[Nav2 Navigation](./04-nav2-humanoid-path-planning.md)**: Path planning for mobile robots and humanoids.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How to train computer vision models using synthetic data.
- The role of GPUs in robotics (Jetson Orin).
- How robots map their environments (VSLAM).
- How robots plan paths to avoid obstacles (Nav2).
