# Interaction History - Task 13

**Date**: 2025-12-08 01:52:00
**Type**: Task Execution

## Prompt Used
"start task 13"

## Work Performed
1. Analyzed `info.md` to retrieve Module 2 curriculum.
2. Created Markdown Content in `frontend/docs/module-2-digital-twin/`:
    - `01-physics-simulation.md`: Intro to digital twins and environment layers.
    - `02-gazebo-basics.md`: Physics engines (ODE/Bullet) and SDF format.
    - `03-unity-hri.md`: Unity for photorealism and ROS-TCP connector.
    - `04-sensors-lidar-imu.md`: Simulating LiDAR, RGB-D, and IMUs.
    - `intro.md`: Updated to serve as Module Index.
3. Marked Task 13 as complete in `tasks.md`.

## Outcome
Module 2 is now populated with content describing simulation environments, effectively bridging the gap between ROS 2 logic and the physical world.
