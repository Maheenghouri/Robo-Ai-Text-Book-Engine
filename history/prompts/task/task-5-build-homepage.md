**Type**: Task Execution

## Prompt Used
"start task 5"

## Work Performed
1. Read `frontend/src/pages/index.tsx`.

3. Implemented **Premium Design**:
    - **Hero Section**: "Build the Future of Physical AI" with gradient text and glow effects.
    - **Styles**: Applied Tailwind properties (`bg-background`, `text-primary`, `glass` utility).
    - **Cards**: Created modular `FeatureCard` components for "ROS 2 Mastery", "Digital Twins", "Vision-Language-Action".
4. Updated `tasks.md` to mark Task 5 as complete.

## Outcome
Homepage now reflects the high-end "Physical AI" aesthetic required by the spec.
