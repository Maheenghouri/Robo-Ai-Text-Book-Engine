# Interaction History - Task 7

**Date**: 2025-12-07 23:59:17
**Type**: Task Execution

## Prompt Used
"start task 7"

## Work Performed
1. Created `frontend/src/pages/login.tsx`.
2. Implemented **Login UI**:
    - Used **Glassmorphism** container (`glass` utility).
    - Added background gradient blobs for visual consistency with the Homepage.
    - Added "Welcome Back" header with gradient text.
3. Implemented **Form Validation**:
    - Added state management for `email`, `password`, `error`.
    - Added checks for empty fields and email regex pattern.
    - Added loading state with spinner animation.
4. Corrected a minor syntax error (`classname` -> `className`).
5. Updated `tasks.md` to mark Task 7 as complete.

## Outcome
Login page is fully functional (frontend-only) and matches the "Premium Design" spec.
