    - Added utility classes `.animate-fade-in-up`, `.animate-float`.
3. Updated `frontend/src/pages/index.tsx`:
    - Integrated `<HeroVisual />` into the Hero Section.
    - Added staggered animation delays for a cinematic entrance.
    - Corrected a syntax error (markdown artifact) during implementation.
4. Updated `tasks.md` to mark Task 6 as complete.

## Outcome
