**Date**: 2025-12-08 02:45:00
**Type**: Task Execution

## Prompt Used
"start task 18"

## Work Performed
1. Created `frontend/src/components/SkillMatrix.tsx`:
    - A dashboard widget to manage Robot Subagents.
    - Features toggles for "Visual Cortex", "Navigation", "Speech", "Motor Control".
    - Calculates "System Resource" usage based on active skills.
2. Updated `frontend/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`:
    - Imported and placed `SkillMatrix` in the main content column.
3. Marked Task 18 as complete in `tasks.md`.
4. **Section 5 (Advanced Features) is now 100% complete.**

## Outcome
The User Dashboard now feels like a true "Command Center", allowing users to configure their simulated robot's brain alongside tracking their learning progress.
